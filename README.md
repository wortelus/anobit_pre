# AnoBIT Wallet
Pre-release repository for AnoBIT v3.0 that is currently in development. Not working, building up the legacy code.
Version v2 is working, however decommissioned and private. If you want to see the code of v2, contact me.

## Future
This is considered as a wallet, but the fact if it should function as full scale network node is still unclear because of language and framework choice. Development on separate high performance Go node is in progress.
